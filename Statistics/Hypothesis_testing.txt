Step 1: 
Null hypothesis: H0: μ=100

Step 2: 
Alternate hypothesis: H1: μ>100

Step 3: 
Set up the significance level (α) -
Significant level (α) is not given in the problem so we meed to assume it as standard which is 5% (0.05).
So α = 0.05

Step 4: 
Z-score calculation using Z table -

confidence interval (C) = 1 - α
                        = 1 - 0.05
					    = 0.95 ( 95%)
					   
A z-score for above mentioned confidence interval (0.95) is 1.645.

Step 5: 
Test statistic using Z score formula:
z score formula = (x-μ)/(σ/√n)
				   where x -> Sample mean
						 μ -> Population mean
						 σ -> Population standard deviation
						 n -> Sample size
						 

Using the above formula,
z = (108-100)/(15/√36)
  = 3.20

Step 6: Acceptence/rejection of null hypothesis -
If test statistics using z score formula(step 5) is greater than z score calculation done using z table (step 4), 
then we will reject the null hypothesis.

Here, Test statistics using z score formula is 3.20 (step 5) 
which is greater than 1.645 (z score calculation done using z table - step 4)
So we will reject null hypothesis i.e. there is raw cornstarch effect..


Note :
We can also use below steps to accept/reject the null hypothesis.
Find the probability by looking at z- table and p-value associated with z-score 3.20 is 0.9993 
i.e. probability of having value less than 108 is 0.9993 and more than or equals to 108 is (1-0.9993)=0.0007.
Since probability(0.0007) is less than 0.05 so we will reject the Null hypothesis i.e. there is raw cornstarch effect.
