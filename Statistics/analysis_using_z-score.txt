Z-score is used to know the number of standard deviations from the mean value of the reference population.

A z-score tells where the score lies on a normal distribution curve. 
For example,
A z-score of zero tells that the value is exactly average while a score of (+/-)3 tells that the value is much higher than average.

Step-1 =>
z-score calculation formula :
z-score = (x-μ)/(σ)
where x -> Sample value
      μ -> Population mean
      σ -> Population standard deviation
	  
In the given example,
x = 1100
μ = 1026
σ = 209

Substitute all parameter in the Z-score formula :
z = (1100-1026)/209
  = 74/209
  = 0.354 (approx)


Step-2 =>
Using the z-score table,
p-value correponding to z-score 0.354 is 0.1368

The z-table shown has scores for the RIGHT of the mean. 
Therefore, we have to add .500 for all of the area LEFT of the mean.

So p-value = 0.5000 + 0.1368 = 0.6368 (63.68 %)

Step-3)
Conclusions :
1. Value 1100 is 0.354 standard deviation above the population mean 1026.
2. 63.38% values are less than 1100 in the population.
