let P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first state, 
P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, 
p1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the first state and 
p2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the second state. 
The number of voters sampled from the first state (n1) = 100, and the number of voters sampled from the second state (n2) = 100.

Now we need to follow below steps to find the voters distribution :
Step-1)
We need to make sure that samples from each population are big enough to model differences with a normal distribution.
As per the center limit theroem, Sample size should be more than 30 to have the normal distribution.

For this scenario,
n1P1 = 100 * 0.52 = 52,
n1(1 - P1) = 100 * 0.48 = 48,
n2P2 = 100 * 0.47 = 47 and
n2(1 - P2) = 100 * 0.53 = 53 are each greater than 30 so the sample size is large enough to proceed using normal distribution.

Step-2)
Mean of the difference in sample proportions: 
E(p1 - p2) = P1 - P2 
           = 0.52 - 0.47 
		   = 0.05

Step-3)
Standard deviation of the difference:
σd = sqrt{ [ P1(1 - P1) / n1 ] + [ P2(1 - P2) / n2 ] }

Substitute values :
σd = sqrt{ [ (0.52)(0.48) / 100 ] + [ (0.47)(0.53) / 100 ] }
σd = sqrt (0.002496 + 0.002491)
   = sqrt(0.004987)
   = 0.0706

Step-4)
Probability calculation. 
This problem requires us to find the probability that p1 is less than p2. 
This is equivalent to finding the probability that p1 - p2 is less than zero. 
To find this probability, we need to transform the random variable (p1 - p2) into a z-score. 

That transformation appears below.
z(p1 - p2) = (x - μ(p1 - p2)) / σd 
           = (0 - 0.05)/0.0706 ( here x = 0, μ(p1 - p2) = 0.05 and σd = 0.0706)
		   = -0.7082

Step-5)
Using z-table for Normal Distribution, 
we find that the probability of a z-score being -0.7082 or less is 0.24.

Therefore, 
The probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state than in the first state is 0.24.
